# Rules

## Abilities

Each of the three **abilities** are used in different circumstances (see [Saves](#saves), below).

**Prowess**: Force, finesse & fortitude.   
**Insight**: Intuition, tinkering & reflexes.   
**Resolve**: Confidence, charisma & attunement.  

## Grit

**Grit** indicates a PC's ability to avoid getting hurt.
It is lost when harmed & recovered after a few hours' rest.
PC's start with *1d6* **Grit**, which they re-roll every time they rest.

## Saves

A save is a roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and circumstances.
PCs roll a *d20* for an appropriate ability score.
If they roll equal to or under that ability score, they pass.
Otherwise, they fail.
In a contest, the highest successful roll wins.

 _Bea encounters a group of heavily-armed Goblins standing guard before a tunnel entrance. Her player carefully plots a course, recognizing that her 13 DEX makes sneaking past the guards the best option. She rolls a *d20*, and resulting in a 10 â€“ a success!_

## Combat

### Attacking

The attacker rolls their weapon die, equal to or under an **Ability**.
When successful, subtract the roll from the target's **Armour**, then deal the remaining total as Harm.

### Multiple Attacks

If **multiple attackers** target the same foe, roll all attack dice and keep the single highest result.
If attacking with **two weapons** at the same time, roll both dice dice and keep the highest.

### Attack Modifiers

If fighting from a position of weakness (such as through cover or with bound hands), the attack is **impaired** and the attacker must roll *1d4* damage regardless of the attacks damage die.
**Unarmed** attacks are always considered **impaired**.
If fighting from a position of advantage (such as against a helpless foe or through a daring manoeuvre), the attack is **enhanced**, allowing the attacker to roll *1d12* damage instead of their normal die.

### Blast
Attacks with the **blast** quality affect all targets in the noted area, rolling separately for each affected character.
Blast refers to anything from explosions to huge cleaving onslaughts to the impact of a meteorite.
If unsure how many targets can be affected, roll the related damage die for a result.

### Initiative & Retreat

Whenever turn order is uncertain, the PCs should make an **Insight** save to see if they go before their enemies.

**Retreating** from a dangerous situation always requires a successful **Insight** save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

## Effort

A PC can chose to make an effort and, before any roll, take *1d6* harm.
They now roll one additional die and choose the best result.

## Harm

Harm is taken from Grit.
Harm that reduces a target's Grit **below** 0 decreases the remainder from

- **Prowess**, if it is physical harm.
- **Insight**, if it is a stress harm.
- **Resolve**, if it is an effort harm.

They must then make an **Ability** Save to avoid **critical harm**.
Some enemies will have special abilities or effects that are triggered when their target fails a **critical harm** save.

### Critical harm

When **critically harmed**, the PC is taken out of combat and have their affected **Ability** reduced in *1* **permanently**.
The PC will die instantly if harmed further, and cannot do anything until stabilised.
If left to their own devices they die within the hour.

If a PC's **Ability** is reduced to 0 they:

- **die**, if it is **Prowess**.
- gain a **condition**, if it is **Insight**.
- **panic**, if it is **Resolve**.

When they are stable, if their new permanent **Ability** is equal or lower than their number of **Advancements**, they can choose an additional **Advancement**.

### Healing

Resting for a few hours and having a meal allow you to re-roll your **Grit**.
Ability loss (see **Critical Harm**) can usually be restored at a rate of one per day, if facilitated by a healer or other appropriate source of expertise.
**Deprived** PCs roll *-1d6* **Grit** when resting.

### Detachments

Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single **detachment**.
When a detachment takes critical damage, it is routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 STR, it is destroyed.

Attacks against detachments by individuals are **impaired** (excluding blast damage).
Attacks against individuals by detachments are **enhanced** and deal blast damage.

### Reactions

When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the Warden may roll 2d6 and consult the following table:

|         |      |         |      |         |
| :-----: | :--: | :-----: | :--: | :-----: |
|    2    | 3-5  |   6-8   | 9-11 |   12    |
| Hostile | Wary | Curious | Kind | Helpful |

### Morale

Enemies must pass a **Resolve** save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number.
Some groups may use their leader's **Resolve** in place of their own.
Lone foes must save when they're reduced to 0 **Grit**.
Morale does not affect PCs.

### Fortune die

When the GM wants to leave some decision to the dice, determine the chances and roll *1d6*.
