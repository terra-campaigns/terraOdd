# Terra Odd
***v0.1.1***

**Terra Odd** is a hack of Cairn / Into the Odd that aims to allow games to be played in different genres and aesthetics.
The first hack is for [Degenesis](https://degenesis.com/).

The main difference is the addition of a modular [Woe mechanic](core-rules.md#Woe), based on [Oddular Mechanics](https://www.bastionland.com/2016/04/oddular-mechanics.html?m=1).
Woe differs narratively, depending on the game theme.
It can be used as infection, corruption, panic, sadness, insanity, etc.

Inventory slots are treated as Burdens and there is an expansion of Backgrounds, for different themes.

This repo also contains my GM materials for planning & running sessions.
It is not always organised.

This webpage and the repository are a fork from [Yochai Gal](https://newschoolrevolution.com).'s [Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com/).
Cairn is based on [Knave](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/250888/Knave) by Ben Milton and [Into The Odd](https://chrismcdee.itch.io/electric-bastionland) by Chris McDowall.
