# Terra Odd

**Terra Odd** is a modular implementation or Cairn / Into the Odd that aims to allow games in to be played in different genres and aesthetics.

It also contains GM materials for planning & running sessions.

This webpage and the repository are a fork from [Yochai Gal](https://newschoolrevolution.com).'s [Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com/).
Cairn is based on [Knave](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/250888/Knave) by Ben Milton and [Into The Odd](https://chrismcdee.itch.io/electric-bastionland) by Chris McDowall.
