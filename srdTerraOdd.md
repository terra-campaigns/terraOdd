### Archetypes

You are defined by an *Archetype*, which encapsulates your background, concept and role within the narrative.
Each *Archetype* should offer an immediate grasp of your identity and behaviours.

You can assign an additional *Attribute* point if you choose to not use *Skills* in your game.

| Skills         | Example usages                                                                                  |

#### Determine Skills  {-}

Your *Archetype* defines $2$ favourite *Skills*.
Choose one.

### Grit

> *"It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward"*
> (Rocky Balboa)

*Grit* is a measure of your ability to avoid *Traumas*.

#### Determine Grit  {-}

Your initial *Grit* is $1d$, and you roll it every time you rest.
Advancements and conditions may change the number of dice you roll.

### Advancements

As you become more seasoned, you gain *Advancements*.
You start the game with $1$ *Advancement*.
The list below are examples of a simple framework for their in-game mechanics.

For every session you play (and survive) you gain $+2$ *Experience*.
You also gain $+1$ *Experience* for each new *Condition* you develop.

Whenever it is narratively coherent, you may spend *Experience* equal to $2\times$ your current number of *Advancements* to gain a new one.

|                   |                                                                                                  |

| Could be worse    | Your **Prowess** *Trauma Save* is rolled *Enhanced*.                                             |
| Danger sense      | Roll $3d6$, if it is higher than your current **Insight**, take the new result.                  |
| Developed         | Roll $3d6$, if it is higher than your current **Prowess**, take the new result.                  |

| Resolute          | Roll $3d6$, if it is higher than your current **Resolve**, take the new result.                  |
| Sensory acuity    | When noticing things through a chosen sense you roll an *Enhanced* *Save*.                       |
| Sleek             | *Enhanced Save* whenever you contort yourself to to break free.                                  |

| Whirlwind         | You are proficient in fighting in melee with two weapons (the off-hand weapon rolls *Impaired*). |

### Conditions

*Conditions* are detrimental mechanically, but not necessarily negative in the narrative.
The list below can be used as a starting point.
With the GM you can adapt these or create new ones.

- **Fear-Driven Vigilance**: Fear instills a heightened sense of vigilance, making you more cautious. In situations related to the your fear, you roll *Impaired*.
- **Obsessive Focus**: Your single-minded pursuit leads to significant personal development and expertise in a specific area, in detriment of others. Swap $1d6$ in two *Attributes*, randomly.
- **Moral Reservations**: Your steadfast morality leads to a firm stance on certain issues. Actions that go against your moral code roll *Impaired*.
- **Compulsive Honesty**: You vow to always speak the truth.
- **Kleptomaniac**: You are unable to resist urges to steal items that you generally don't really need.
- **Battle-Scarred**: After some injury, you develop a scar. You might have lost part of a member, an eye, or something else that impacts you physically, intellectually or socially.
- **Protective Instinct**: You are genuinely concerned with your team's welfare, and become a reluctant leader. When an ally is in danger, you roll *Imparied*.
- **Estranged**: You lose the bond with someone you love or cherish. With the GM, agree the mechanical impact.
- **Slow**: You always act after your opponents.

### Equipment 

The table below contains example weapons, and may be expanded with the GM.
For ranges, use what is narratively appropriate.

|  Harm  | Melee Examples                             | Ranged Examples<br>(Single Shot)                 | Ranged Examples<br>(Blast)                                        |
| :----: | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $1d3$  | **Unarmed**                                | Throwing **Objects**                             |                                                                   |
| $1d4$  | Small **Primitive**                        |                                                  |                                                                   |

Armours act as buffers when you take damage.
Subtract the armour modifier from the *Effect* before reducing your *Grit*

| Armour     | Modifier | Details                                            |
| ---------- | :------: | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Light**  |   $-1e$  |                                                    |
| **Heavy**  |   $-2e$  | $-1d$ to run, observe, sneak, swim, etc.           |
| **Shield** |   $-1e$  | Can be sacrificed to completely avoid an *Effect*. |

## Rules

### Saves

A *Save* is a roll to avoid danger from a risky action or situation.
Roll $1d20$ equal to or under an *Attribute* to be successful.
When *Impaired*, roll $2$ dice and take the worst.
When *Enhanced*, roll $2$ dice and take the best.

In the context of a contest, both sides roll their *Saves*.
The highest result that is successful wins the contest.

### Conflicts

An aggressor rolls a die dictated by their weapon.
If you roll equal or under the appropriate *Attribute* you succeed.
Subtract the opposition's *Armour*, if appropriate, and cause the result as *Effect*.
When *Impaired*, roll 2 dice and take the worst.
When *Enhanced*, roll 2 dice and take the best.

If multiple attackers target the same opponent, roll all *Effect* and keep the single highest result.
**Blast** aggressions hit their die in opponents, rolling separate for each.

If turn order in uncertain, roll an **Insight** *Save*.
Retreating from a dangerous situation requires a **Prowess** *Save*.

### Harm

You lose *Grit* when you are harmed.
When your *Grit* reaches $0$ you start taking *Trauma*.

Push yourself trauma is reduced from Resolve.
Stress trauma is reduced from Insight.
Physical trauma is reduced from Prowess.

Reduce the remaining *Effect* for an *Attribute* of your choice.

When an *Attribute* is reduced, immediately make a *Save*.
You push through if you succeed.
Otherwise you have a *Critical Trauma*.
You will die instantly if harmed further, and cannot perform any actions until attended to.
If left to your own devices you die in one hour.

If you survive a *Critical Trauma*, the attribute responsible for it is permanently reduced in $1$ as you develop a *Malaise*.
With the GM, describe it narratively.

#### Recovery {-}

After a well fed and rested night, you roll and reset your *Grit*.
If you are deprived you have $-1d$ to roll for *Grit*.
*Trauma* is recovered at the pace of $1$ Attribute score per week, with the aid of a healer.
A *Malaise* never recovers.

#### Pushing yourself {-}

Before you roll you can take $1d6$ *Effect* and use the same value to "fix" your result down.
If your *Grit* becomes exactly $0$ you suffer a *Panic Event*.
Remaining *Effect* is taken by an *Attribute*, depending on how you pushed yourself.

| $d6$  | Panic Event Outcome                                                                                                               |
| :---: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $1:3$ | You **Flight**. Lose $1d6$ **Resolve**, and you are compelled to leave the scene.                                                 |
| $4:5$ | You **Freeze**. Lose $1d6$ **Prowess**, and you cannot move, silently or otherwise.                                               |
|  $6$  | You **Fight**. Lose $1d6$ **Insight**, and you become obsessed with being successful during the scene. You gain an *Advancement*. |

Describe the outcome narratively.
In any case, after the scene ends, you gain a *Condition*.
With the GM, determine the mechanical effects and how to introduce your *Condition* into the narrative.

### Challenges

The following table contain *Challenges* divided in **Tiers**, as examples.

|                 | Save | Grit | Harm  | Examples                                                             |
| --------------- | :--- | ---- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trivial**     | 5    | 1    | $1d4$ | Unskilled adversaries, low height climb, known journey               |
| **Dangerous**   | 8    | 5    | $1d6$ | Skilled adversaries, small predator, large prey, troublesome journey |
| **Serious**     | 12   | 10   | $2d6$ | Expert adversaries, large predator, traverse fire or acid            |
| **Formidable**  | 16   | 15   | $3d6$ | Human prime, apex predator, climbing the Everest                     |
| **Exceptional** | 20   | 20   | $4d6$ | Transhuman, often fatal environments, heroic journeys                |

When you reduce a *Challenge*'s **Grit** to $0$, it must pass a *Resolve Save*, otherwise it gives up.

### Fortune die

When the GM wants to leave some decision to the dice, determine the chances and roll $1d$.

### Sayonara

At any moment you can decide it is your last scene.
When you do that, choose a song and then re-roll your *Grit*.
For this scene all your rolls are *Enhanced*.
By the end of the scene, you have to figure out how you depart (death, madness, mission, Etc.).
You can create a new character with half (rounded up) the number of *Advancements* the previous character had.
