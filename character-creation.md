# Character Creation

1. If you are creating a new party, define a cohesive group concept with the other players.
2. Roll or choose your [Background](#backgrounds). Use the tables on each background.
3. Roll your [Attributes](#attributes).
4. Roll your [Hit Protection](#hit-protection).
5. Roll or choose your [Bond](#bonds).
6. Take note of your [Burdens](#burdens).

## Backgrounds

The following Backgrounds sets are available.

#### <a href="https://cairnrpg.com/wip/backgrounds/" target="_blank">Cairn 2e Backgrounds (WIP)</a>

#### <a href="https://terra-campaigns.github.io/degenesis/systems/backgrounds/00_backgrounds/" target="_blank">Degenesis Cults & Clans</a>


## Attributes

- Player Characters have just three Attributes: (**Strength (STR)**, **Dexterity (DEX)**, and **Willpower (WIL)**). 
- Roll ***2d6+3*** for each of your character's **Attributes**, in order. You may then swap any two of the results. 
- Attributes are not universal descriptors. A character with a low STR is not necessarily hopelessly weak; they can still attempt to lift a heavy door or survive a deadly fight! Their risk is simply higher. 

## Hit Protection

- Roll 1d6 to determine your PC's starting **Hit Protection (HP)**, which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. It does not indicate a characterâ€™s health or fortitude, nor do they lose it for very long. See [Healing & Recovery](core-rules.md#Healing%20&%20Recovery). 
- If an attack would take a PC's HP exactly to 0, the player must roll on the [Scars](core-rules.md#Scars) table.

## Bonds

Bonds tie you to someone else and the world.
You may resolve your Bond, and will be awarded Growth.
Once resolved, you may roll a new Bond.

The following Bonds sets are available.

## Burdens

- Characters have a total of ten **Burden** slots but can only carry four or five items comfortably without the help of bags, backpacks, horses, carts, etc.
- Inventory is abstract, dependent only on the fiction as adjudicated by the Warden.
- Anyone carrying **10 Burdens** is reduced to **0 HP**. A character cannot fill more than ten slots.

### Burden Slots

- Most items take up one slot unless otherwise indicated. 
- _Petty_ items do not take up any slots. _Bulky_ items take up two slots. 
- Each Fatigue you gain occupies one **Burden** slot.
