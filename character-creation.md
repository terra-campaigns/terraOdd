## Attributes

- Player Characters have just three Attributes: (**Strength (STR)**, **Dexterity (DEX)**, and **Willpower (WIL)**). 
- Roll ***2d6+3*** for each of your character's **Attributes**, in order. You may then swap any two of the results. 
- Attributes are not universal descriptors. A character with a low STR is not necessarily hopelessly weak; they can still attempt to lift a heavy door or survive a deadly fight! Their risk is simply higher. 

## Hit Protection

- Roll 1d6 to determine your PC's starting **Hit Protection (HP)**, which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. It does not indicate a character’s health or fortitude, nor do they lose it for very long. See [Healing & Recovery](core-rules.md#Healing%20&%20Recovery). 
- If an attack would take a PC's HP exactly to 0, the player must roll on the [Scars](core-rules.md#Scars) table.

## Burdens

- Characters have a total of ten burden slots but can only carry four or five items comfortably without the help of bags, backpacks, horses, carts, etc.
- Each PC starts with a **Backpack** that can hold up to six slots of items or **Fatigue**. Carts (which must be pulled with both hands), horses, or mules can make a huge difference in how much a PC can bring with them on an adventure. **Hirelings** can also be paid to carry equipment. 
- Inventory is abstract, dependent only on the fiction as adjudicated by the Warden. Anyone carrying a full inventory (i.e. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 HP. A character cannot fill more than ten slots.

### Burden Slots

- Most items take up one slot unless otherwise indicated. 
- _Petty_ items do not take up any slots. _Bulky_ items take up **two** slots. 
- A bag of coins worth less than 100gp is _petty_ and does not occupy a slot.

## Fallout

If you are exposed to the primer, or take drugs, you suffer Primer infection.

Note:
The amount and frequency of how you deal Primer infection establishes the tone and pacing of your game.
It is a dial to control the amount of Primer your players encounter and how likely they are to change as a result.

|            |                 |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| ***1***    | **GLIMPSE**     |
| ***1d4***  | **CONTACT**     |
| ***1d6***  | **EXPOSURE**    |
| ***1d8***  | **CATASTROPHE** |
| ***1d10*** | **DOOM**        |

Infection damage reduces your HP but gives you an equal amount of STR and WILL until the end of the scene.
If reduced to exactly 0 HP, you get an infection emergent affloration.
If reduced beyond 0 HP, you lose DEX.
Make a save and, if failed, you develop a mutation.
