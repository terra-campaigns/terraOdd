# Terra Odd System Reference v0.7.1

**Terra Odd** is licensed under [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).  

**Terra Odd** is a generic game to play multi-genre **Terra Campaigns**.
Each campaign has its own thematic fork.

**Terra Odd**'s design philosophies are:  

**Neutrality**: The Warden's role is to portray the rules, situations, NPCs, and narrative clearly, while acting as a neutral arbiter.  
**Classless**: A character's role or skills are not limited by a single class. Instead, the equipment they carry and their experiences define their specialty.  
**Death**: Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in its many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning.  
**Fiction First**: Dice do not always reflect an obstacle's difficulty or its outcome. Instead, success and failure are arbitrated by the Warden in dialogue with the players, based on in-world elements.  
**Growth**: Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.
**Player Choice**: Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they've made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.  
**Principles**: The Warden and the players each have guidelines that help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.  
**Shared Objectives**: Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.
