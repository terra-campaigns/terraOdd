### Archetypes

You are defined by an *Archetype*, which encapsulates your background, concept and role within the narrative.
Each *Archetype* should offer an immediate grasp of your identity and behaviours.
It is expected you will evolve beyond these initial *Archetypes* towards unique narratives.



### Attributes




#### Determine Attributes  {-}

For each *Attribute* roll $3d6$.
You can swap two results.
These are your permanent *Attribute* values.
During play, their values will change.
Sometimes permanently (through *Malaises*).

### Skills

Using *Skills* is optional.
You can assign an additional *Attribute* point if you choose to not use *Skills* in your game.

Every time a *Skill* is relevant for a roll, consider the relevant *Attribute* with $+1$ for comparing the roll.

#### Determine Skills  {-}

Your *Archetype* defines $2$ favourite *Skills*.
Choose one.

### Grit

### Advancements

As you become more seasoned, you gain *Advancements*.
You start the game with $1$ *Advancement*.
The list below are examples of a simple framework for their in-game mechanics.

For every session you play (and survive) you gain $+2$ *Experience*.
You also gain $+1$ *Experience* for each new *Condition* you develop.

Whenever it is narratively coherent, you may spend *Experience* equal to $2\times$ your current number of *Advancements* to gain a new one.

### Conditions

*Conditions* are detrimental mechanically, but not necessarily negative in the narrative.
The list below can be used as a starting point.
With the GM you can adapt these or create new ones.

- **Fear-Driven Vigilance**: Fear instills a heightened sense of vigilance, making you more cautious. In situations related to the your fear, you roll *Impaired*.
- **Obsessive Focus**: Your single-minded pursuit leads to significant personal development and expertise in a specific area, in detriment of others. Swap $1d6$ in two *Attributes*, randomly.
- **Moral Reservations**: Your steadfast morality leads to a firm stance on certain issues. Actions that go against your moral code roll *Impaired*.
- **Compulsive Honesty**: You vow to always speak the truth.
- **Kleptomaniac**: You are unable to resist urges to steal items that you generally don't really need.
- **Battle-Scarred**: After some injury, you develop a scar. You might have lost part of a member, an eye, or something else that impacts you physically, intellectually or socially.
- **Protective Instinct**: You are genuinely concerned with your team's welfare, and become a reluctant leader. When an ally is in danger, you roll *Imparied*.
- **Estranged**: You lose the bond with someone you love or cherish. With the GM, agree the mechanical impact.
- **Slow**: You always act after your opponents.

The table below contains example weapons, and may be expanded with the GM.

Armours act as buffers when you take damage.
Subtract the armour modifier from the *Effect* before reducing your *Grit*

| **Heavy**  |   $-2e$  | $-1d$ to run, observe, sneak, swim, etc.           |

### Challenges



### Fortune die

You can create a new character with half (rounded up) the number of *Advancements* the previous character had.
