# Judges

> The [Judges](https://degenesis.com/world/cults/judges) brought law to the wastelands. WithÂ hammer and musket, they confronted the savages, hiding their faces behind wide brimmed hats. They conjured hailstorms of lead, slaughtered the Cockroach Clan and judged outlaws with a blow of their hammers.
