# Hellvetics

> Deep within the Alps, they expected the Eshaton. They were not spared in the ensuing inferno, however. The Reaper’s Blow cut through their Fortress, tearing open ravines and belching magma. As hellfire swept through their lands, the [Hellvetics](https://degenesis.com/world/cults/hellvetics) confronted nature’s wrath. The Alps may have been broken, but the Hellvetics were not.
