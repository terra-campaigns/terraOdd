# Chroniclers

> The Stream once extended over the world and touched every mind. It recorded and catalogued every moment, the pure, digital knowledge of mankind bundled in its evolutionary algorithms. Deep down, at the bottom of this sea of data, something stirred. Humans sought it and found something that they didn’t understand, but that they could believe in. [Chroniclers](https://degenesis.com/world/cults/chroniclers) want to bring The Stream back.
